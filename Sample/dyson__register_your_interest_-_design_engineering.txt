About Us




Dyson is a global technology enterprise. We solve the problems others choose to ignore, with surprising new inventions that defy convention and simply work better. We’re growing fast and our ambition is huge - more categories, more locations, and more people. We push the boundaries of what others have defined as possible. Our approach starts with an engineering mindset and different thinking. Then we continuously refine our ideas - unwilling to compromise and driven by an obsession for finding a better way. Design Engineering is the powerhouse of product creation. By integrating the work of specialists, we deliver a user-focused manufacturable product solution, keeping Dyson products in front of the competition. As part of a cross functional project team, we turn product concepts into robust manufacturable designs, at part, assembly and product levels. We collaborate with Manufacturing and suppliers to concurrently deliver a product design and a capable manufacturing process.




About The Role




We are recruiting for all levels including Design Engineer, Senior Design Engineer & Lead Design Engineer. You will be joining an innovative & dynamic team, supporting the realisation and growth of a product category for Dyson. You will use your design engineering expertise to identify & resolve technical challenges in partnership with stakeholders from cross functional teams. You will work autonomously as part of a multi-disciplined team, Iteratively, to create robust specifications & designs on spec, on time, to cost and quality targets. Responsibilities include:




 * Have a clear understanding of the problem at hand and specify the design requirements with clear, specific, and measurable objectives.
 * Recognize any technical, cost or regulatory constraints that may impact the feasibility of the design.
 * Robustly plan and prioritize tasks based on risk level, resolution, maturity and interdependency of tasks. Coordinate with the work of others to maximize learning and minimize waste.
 * Monitor progress in line with the established plan, and proactively respond or escalate issues when required.
 * Generate a range of design concepts and systematically evaluate each concept against the design requirements to identify the optimal solution.
 * Conduct thorough tolerance analysis to identify and quantify the impact of various sources of variability on the design. Develop strategies to reduce the tolerance sensitivity and ensure the final design can operate with acceptable performance at the production limits of the design parts.
 * Identify potential risks associated with the design and develop strategies to mitigate or eliminate those risks. Work closely with cross functional team to conduct thorough risk assessments and use risk management tools to evaluate and prioritize risks.
 * Work closely with cross-functional teams to ensure that the design is optimized for assembly, manufacturing and cost. Create detailed design specifications, including Engineering Bill of Materials, 3D models, CAD drawings, and technical specifications.


About you


 * A relevant degree in an Engineering, Product Design, Industrial Design, Scientific discipline or equivalent.
 * A sound understanding of mechanical principles. Previous experience in design, development, and delivery of Consumer/ Robotic / and or Regulated products.
 * Ability to effectively identify, define, prioritize, document and track technical requirements throughout the product development process.
 * Excellent problem solving and analytical ability using a variety of methodologies.
 * Knowledge and understanding of multiple tooling and manufacturing techniques.
 * Practical knowledge of 3D CAD, PLM systems and analysis packages.
 * Ability to robustly plan, prioritise tasks and coordinate with the work of others.
 * Ability to communicate effectively through a variety of media
 * Ability to collaborate with a team and influence others to successfully deliver results in a timely manner.

Malaysia Development Centre: A world-class development centre




In 2003, after 10 years of rapid expansion in the UK, Malaysia was chosen as an additional location to allow the continued growth of Dyson’s manufacturing and testing facility. It was close to component manufacturers and much of the supply chain, as well as providing very high levels of manufacturing quality. Over time, Dyson operations expanded in Malaysia. Having started out with a team of just 10, today our Malaysia Design Centre has grown to be a base for more than 1,200 skilled Dyson people working across Engineering, IT, Finance, Creative and HR. Our Johor facility had humble beginnings, but what was originally a few small labs covering 350m² is now a bustling campus occupying 50,000m², including state-of-art acoustic chamber, environmental chamber, and rapid prototyping facilities. It’s an important centre for research, development, design and testing – home to an exceptional team.





Benefits

Dyson Malaysia monitors the market to ensure competitive salaries and bonuses. Beyond that, you’ll enjoy a transport allowance and comprehensive medical care and insurance. But financial benefits are just the start of a Dyson career. Professional growth, leadership development and new opportunities abound, driven by regular reviews and dynamic workshops. And with a vibrant culture, the latest devices and a relaxed dress code reflecting our engineering spirit, it’s an exciting team environment geared to fuelling and realising ambition.




Dyson is an equal opportunity employer. We know that great minds don’t think alike, and it takes all kinds of minds to make our technology so unique. We welcome applications from all backgrounds and employment decisions are made without regard to race, colour, religion, national or ethnic origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, protected veteran status or other any other dimension of diversity.

Johnson Matthey, a FTSE 100 company, is a global leader in sustainable technologies specialising in catalysis, precious metal products, chemicals and process technology. With operations in over 30 countries, we employ more than 13,000 people. Johnson Matthey uses science to make the world cleaner and healthier. Over the past two centuries we have built our reputation and place as a global leader through quality, integrity, and innovation. Today, more than 93% of the group's sales come from products and services which provide sustainability benefits through the positive impact they have on the environment, resource efficiency and human health, but that’s not enough. We have ambitious plans for growth and need talented individuals to help shape and lead us into our next century.

As a Senior Cloud Devops Engineer, you will develop automated systems to keep things in continuous deployment running smoothly and implement monitoring to identify issues. You will specialize in ensuring the stable performance of our infrastructure and learn how to scale that infrastructure as the demands on our department increase.

The successful candidate will work alongside colleagues in design, delivery and engineering. We are looking for someone who is experienced in building cloud infrastructure. The holder will be keen to understand what’s needed to support our applications in production as well as what tools and automations are required by their team to be effective.

Your responsibilities:

 * Working with a variety of teams across Johnson Matthey, you’ll identify problems or bottlenecks in processes and work across the organisation to improve these.
 * We have a level 2 support team, you’ll work to enable that team to solve more problems (and therefore we’ll be more responsive to our users). Ideally though, we’ll be identifying issues before they arise and applying permanent fixes
 * You’ll work as part of an agile team, you will encourage a “T-Shaped” and “Don’t be blocked” mindset in your fellow team members, and you’ll expect the same from your fellow team members.
 * You’ll be open and honest about your individual successes and failures. Work to keep an environment where we openly learn from our failures and share them with others so we can contribute to everyone’s success.
 * Manage and prioritise demand of varying timelines, complexity, and scope.
 * Maintain and manage stakeholder and third-party relationships
 * Ensure that company policies, standards, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) are always adhered to.
   
   

Requirements for the role:

 * Early and continual input is essential for building reliable systems which are easy to support. You’ll want to contribute at all stages of the development lifecycle.
 * You’ll be a cloud native – deploying solutions into the cloud automatically, using IaC At JM we build our digital platforms in Azure as the source of truth, automation and documentation will feel natural to you. We use both AWS and Azure but have a preference for Azure.
 * Experience with infrastructure scripting solutions such as PowerShell, Python andTerraform are expected, with skills in Ansible, Puppet and Chef also desirable.
 * Experience administering and deploying development CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions, GitLab, or Jenkins. We use GitHub and GitHub Actions
 * Application monitoring will be essential to measure our performance, you’ll have ideas about the kinds of things we should be measuring and be able to implement these.
 * You’ll have the ability to focus on processes and procedures rather than results and underlying causes. You’ll try to understand a design problem before trying to fix it. You won’t try to force solutions that worked on old problems onto new problems.
 * You’ll have used a range of services available in Azure, and integrated this in an enterprise environment. SSO tools like Okta, and services such as Azure B2C and FucntionApps. Building serverless digital products will feel normal and natural for you.
